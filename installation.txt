Install LISA to your computer!

== System Requirements ==
  * Apache 2 or other compatible webserver with rewrite module and “Allowoverride All” option for the virtual
  * PHP 5.3

== Recommended libraries ==
  * PHP GD library, if you want to use "on the fly" image resizing system
  * PHP MCrypt library, if you want to use \Util\CipherCrypt class

== Installation ==
   1. Set up the webserver virtual host, to webroot directory and enable rewrite modul on virtual host.
   2. In UNIX like system run setpermissions.sh from install/permissions directory.

===Piece of advice===
  * In webroot/.htaccess php_flag display_errors 0, so if you are in developement stage, set this flag to 1
  * LISA defaultly hide all error message, specify write errors in log files in tmp/log directory
  * Autoloader index classes by file name, so the class name and the file name must match, and in 1 file must be only 1 class.
